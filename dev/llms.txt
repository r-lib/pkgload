# pkgload

The goal of pkgload is to simulate the process of installing and loading
a package, without actually doing the complete process, and hence making
package iteration much faster. This was previously part of devtools (it
was in fact the original motivation) but has been moved into its own
package as part of the devtools [conscious
uncoupling](https://github.com/r-lib/devtools#conscious-uncoupling).

## Usage

In most cases you will not use pkgload directly, and instead you’ll call
it via `devtools::load_all()`.

``` r
devtools::load_all()
```
