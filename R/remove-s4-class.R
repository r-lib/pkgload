# Remove an s4 class from a package loaded by devtools
#
# For classes loaded with devtools, this is necessary so that R doesn't try to
# modify superclasses that don't have references to this class. For example,
# suppose you have package pkgA with class A, and pkgB with class B, which
# contains A. If pkgB is loaded with load_all(), then class B will have a
# reference to class A, and unloading pkgB the normal way, with
# unloadNamespace("pkgB"), will result in some errors. They happen because R
# will look at B, see that it is a superclass of A, then it will try to modify
# A by removing subclass references to B.
#
# This function sidesteps the problem by modifying B. It finds all the classes
# in B@contains which also have references back to B, then modifies B to keep
# references to those classes, but remove references to all other classes.
# Finally, it removes B. Calling removeClass("B") tells the classes referred to
# in B@contains to remove their references back to B.
#
# It is entirely possible that this code is necessary only because of bugs in
# R's S4 implementation.

# @param package The package object which contains the class.
