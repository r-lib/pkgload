#' Replacement version of system.file
#'
#' This function is meant to intercept calls to [base::system.file()],
#' so that it behaves well with packages loaded by devtools. It is made
#' available when a package is loaded with [load_all()].
#'
#' When `system.file` is called from the R console (the global
#' environment), this function detects if the target package was loaded with
#' [load_all()], and if so, it uses a customized method of searching
#' for the file. This is necessary because the directory structure of a source
#' package is different from the directory structure of an installed package.
#'
#' When a package is loaded with `load_all`, this function is also inserted
#' into the package's imports environment, so that calls to `system.file`
#' from within the package namespace will use this modified version. If this
#' function were not inserted into the imports environment, then the package
#' would end up calling `base::system.file` instead.
#' @inheritParams base::system.file
